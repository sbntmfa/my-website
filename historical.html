<h1>Hijrah - Migration to Madinah</h1>
<hr>
<h2>622 CE, Makkah to Madinah</h2>
<hr>
<p>The Hijrah marks the migration of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his followers from <b>Makkah</b> to <b>Madinah</b> to escape persecution. This event laid the foundation for the first Islamic state.</p>
<p>During this migration, the Muslim community faced many challenges, including <i>hostility</i> from the Quraysh and the hardships of traveling in harsh conditions. The migration demonstrated courage, faith, and trust in Allah.</p>
<p>As a result, the Muslim community grew stronger, establishing <b>Madinah</b> as a center for Islamic governance and education. The Hijrah also marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar.</p>
