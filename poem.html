	<h1>Guided by Faith</h1>
	
	<hr>

	<h3>By Amina Siddiqui</h3>
	<p>
		In the light of Allah, we <i>find our way,</i><br>
		Through trials and nights, and the <i>brightest day.</i><br>
		With <b>prayers on lip</b>s and hearts so true,<br>
		We walk the path that is <b>blessed</b> for you.<br>
	</p>

	<hr>

	<p>
		rough <i>patience</i> and <b>charity</b>,our spirits rise,<br>
		Seeing the world through <i>compassionate eyes.</i><br>
		Faith guides our steps, both near and far,<br>
		With <b>hope</b> and love as our guiding star.<br>
	</p>

	<hr>

		Every dawn brings a <i>new chance</i> to grow,<br>
		To follow the teachings we <b>truly know.</b><br>
		In submission to Allah, our hearts take flight,<br>
		Shining with <b>grace</b> and <i>divine light.</i><br>
